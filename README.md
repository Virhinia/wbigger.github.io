Here you can find my school projects and open-source courses about computer science and IT. You are welcome to study, modify and share these works!

Primary target of these courses are students of Italian technical institute, computer science and telecommunications orientation; however, I hope they can be useful also for all the CS/IT students.

## School's official page on GitHub
Here the official organization page of my school on GitHub: [IIS G. Marconi Civitavecchia](https://github.com/marconicivitavecchia). This organization is also connected with GitHub educate.

## Research projects
As teacher, I am following some research project with students and other teachers of my school:
- [Easy Talk](https://github.com/marconicivitavecchia/easy-talk), a technology to facilitate learning of social skills to help people with communication difficulties. Uses MS Azure Face API, Angular and Node.js.
- [Domotics & VR](https://github.com/marconicivitavecchia/m4m-domotics), a prototype of a real home automation system, including electrical system, electronics, firmware, web server and a 3D environment that communicate in real time with the real environment. We used Node-RED, MQTT, Unity, Blender, Oculus Rift, Sonoff, ACME CM3. 

## Student projects
A list of projects developed with the following courses are listed [here](./orgs.md).

## Teacher Test Suite
To support the student assessments, I created a [test suite](https://github.com/wbigger/teacher-test-suite) with the following objectives:
- support multiple choice questions and open answers questions with evaluation grid
- propose tips to create good multiple answers
- easy to print, to match the needs of the Italian school
- create a different test for each student of the class, according to the student needs
- support specific learning disabilities, removing questions according to student disability or extending the maximum time
- create a profile of the student with strengths and weaknesses, to help the teacher developing effective strategies both for students and for the whole class
- provide statistics both for single questions and students, with tips for the teacher to improve the future classwork

Not all the above feature are currently implemented, but work is in progress and continuously updated.


# Courses

Below is a list of the material I wrote for my courses. I hope they can help other teachers.

Please consider that all courses are in Italian language.

Courses are created with [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/mdBook), a nice static site generator written in Rust (a language that i really love ❤️).


## First and second year
### Computer Science
Link: [https://wbigger.github.io/book-programming/](https://wbigger.github.io/book-programming/)

Start learning to code with Lightbot and Processing 3D. We will talk about problems, constraints, design, user stories, documentation, variables, flow control, objects and classes, 3D objects.  

## Third year
### Computer Science
Link: [https://wbigger.github.io/book-cs-3y/](https://wbigger.github.io/book-cs-3y/)

A comparative introduction to software programming using Python and C++. A slightly philosophical approach is used to understand types and classes. The use case for this courses is a simple web app, using basic HTML5.

### Computer Systems and Networking
Link: [https://wbigger.github.io/book-arch-cpu/](https://wbigger.github.io/book-arch-cpu/)

How is a computer made? this course covers the basics of CPU architecture and networking, using Raspberry PI, mobile phones, C language, terminal, gcc and assembly.

### Technologies and design for computer systems
Link: [https://wbigger.github.io/book-tpsi-3y/](https://wbigger.github.io/book-tpsi-3y/)

Operating systems, Raspberry PI, MPU vs CPU, Kernel, GNU utils, Scheduler, Memory

## Forth year
### Computer Systems and Networking
Link: [https://wbigger.github.io/book-4y-networks/](https://wbigger.github.io/book-4y-networks/)

Here we talk about ISO/OSI level 2, 3 and 4. We try to understand how the networks and routing fundamentals using a historical approach.

## Fifth year
### Technologies and design for computer systems
Link: [https://wbigger.github.io/book-tpsi-5y/](https://wbigger.github.io/book-tpsi-5y)

Deploy a web application in the cloud!

## Other courses
### HTML5

Link: [https://wbigger.github.io/book-html5/](https://wbigger.github.io/book-html5/)

How to implement and deploy effectively a web page? starting from the visual artifact of our web page, we go through HTML cutting and implementation, CSS styling and creating and querying a REST API with JavaScript. Finally, we deploy our web page on the cloud with AWS services. Special attention is paid to the history of the web, to better understand the present trends.
