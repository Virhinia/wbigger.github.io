Here you can find my school projects and open-source courses about computer science and IT. You are welcome to study, modify and share these works!

Primary target of these courses are students of Italian technical institute, computer science and telecommunications orientation; however, I hope they can be useful also for all the CS/IT students.

## School's official page on GitHub
Here the official organization page of my school on GitHub: [IIS G. Marconi Civitavecchia](https://github.com/marconicivitavecchia). This organization is also connected with GitHub educate.

## Research projects
As teacher, I am following some research project with students and other teachers of my school:
- [Easy Talk](https://github.com/marconicivitavecchia/easy-talk), a technology to facilitate learning of social skills to help people with communication difficulties. Uses MS Azure Face API, Angular and Node.js.
- [Domotics & VR](https://github.com/marconicivitavecchia/m4m-domotics), a prototype of a real home automation system, including electrical system, electronics, firmware, web server and a 3D environment that communicate in real time with the real environment. We used Node-RED, MQTT, Unity, Blender, Oculus Rift, Sonoff, ACME CM3. 

## Student projects
A list of projects developed with the following courses are listed [here](./orgs.md).

## Teacher Test Suite
To support the student assessments, I created a [test suite](https://github.com/wbigger/teacher-test-suite) with the following objectives:
- support multiple choice questions and open answers questions with evaluation grid
- propose tips to create good multiple answers
- easy to print, to match the needs of the Italian school
- create a different test for each student of the class, according to the student needs
- support specific learning disabilities, removing questions according to student disability or extending the maximum time
- create a profile of the student with strengths and weaknesses, to help the teacher developing effective strategies both for students and for the whole class
- provide statistics both for single questions and students, with tips for the teacher to improve the future classwork

Not all the above feature are currently implemented, but work is in progress and continuously updated.
