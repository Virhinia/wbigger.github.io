# Welcome to wbigger's page!

Here you can find my school projects and open-source courses about computer science and IT. You are welcome to study, modify and share these works!

Primary target of these courses are students of Italian technical institute, computer science and telecommunications orientation; however, I hope they can be useful also for all the CS/IT students.
